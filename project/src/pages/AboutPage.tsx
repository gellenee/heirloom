          <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-primary">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Our mission is to help heritage speakers bridge the gap between passive understanding 
            and active speaking, especially in emotionally meaningful contexts. We believe that 
            language is more than just vocabulary and grammar—it's a vital connection to family, 
            identity, and cultural heritage.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-primary">The Heritage Speaker Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Many heritage speakers grew up hearing a language from family or community, but do not 
            speak it fluently. They often understand it passively but struggle to speak it actively—especially 
            in emotionally important contexts like family gatherings, expressing love or apology, or 
            discussing cultural traditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This disconnect can lead to feelings of shame, frustration, or cultural isolation. Heirloom 
            provides a supportive environment to practice these exact conversations without 
            judgment or pressure.
          </p>
